The snow-covered valleys of Kashmir transform into a serene wonderland during winter.
Towering mountains wear a blanket of white, and pine trees glisten under the frosty touchof nature.
The crisp air carries the faint sound of footsteps on freshly fallen snow, and the
warmth of kahwa tea becomes a delightful companion. In Kashmir, winter isn't just a
seasonâ€”it's poetry in every flake
