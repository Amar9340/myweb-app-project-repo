The rain in Kashmir breathes life into its lush meadows and verdant valleys. It casts a mystical veil over the region, as mist rises to embrace the towering Chinar trees. The gentle drumming of raindrops against rooftops and leaves creates a soothing symphony. In Kashmir, rain feels like nature's own poetry, painting the land with fresh hues of green.
